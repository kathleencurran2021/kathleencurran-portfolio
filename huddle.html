      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Research shows that peer-to-peer connections are vital to thriving in an academic environment. These
        connections drive success not only socially, but also in terms of information about the school and career
        connections. There is quite a bit of research on undergraduate social support and subsequent orientation
        programs, but these
        seem to be optional or not prioritized for graduate student programs. </p>
      <p>In a program as large as the University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI), it is easy to get lost in the
        crowd, and it is especially
        difficult to enter this environment and connect with peers during Covid. This has resulted in a class that feels
        disconnected and lonely. </p>

      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>Huddle is a project that hopes to bring together graduate students at UMSI. While there were some online
        platforms like Facebook that some were using to communicate, there was no centralized platform that people were
        comfortable just connecting with each other on. </p>
      <span><b>My project sought to answer the following:</b></span><br>
      <ol>
        <li>What kinds of connections at UMSI are students looking for? </li>
        <li>What has worked for students socially so far? </li>
        <li>Where are students struggling the most?</li>
        <li>How can a digital tool facilitate social connection at UMSI? </li>

      <h3>Scope and Constraints</h3>
      <p>
        This was a short term project of about four months, so I was not able to spend as much time doing testing and
        redesigning as I would have liked. This application is also limited to my audience of UMSI graduate students.

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <h3>Interviews</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Before designing anything, I needed more information, so I conducted interviews with 5 UMSI students.
            <b>Each interviewee expressed that they had difficulty making friends.</b>
          <p>I had expected a result like this as it lined up with my initial research questions. However, most
            participants also expressed that <b> wanted a grad student-specific guide to UMSI</b>.
          </p>
          <p>Any other information they had found about Ann Arbor or UMSI had been disorganized or not specific to grad
            students, making it difficult to know if it was relevant to them.</p>

        <h3>
          Survey
        </h3>
        <p>To better understand how users of varying abilities engaged with sahiyo.org, we launched a survey to the
          Sahiyo community, asking about their experience with the website, their role in Sahiyo, their disability
          status, and how often they used the site. </p>
        <p>
          The survey had several limitations that weakened our data’s accuracy. First, we did not receive enough
          responses for our survey results to be statistically significant. Secondly, the majority of respondents were
          either Sahiyo staff or volunteers which may not be representative of typical users. </p>
        <p>
          However, our results indicated that <b>users with disabilities had a more difficult time using the site than
            those without disabilities.</b> </p>
        <div class="survey-img-container">
          <figure class="surv-res-fig">
            <img class="survey-results-img" src="images/survey-results.png"
              alt="Crosstab image showing results from a survey question asking about user's experience with Sahiyo">

              those who did
              not </figcaption>
          </figure>

        </div>

        <p>While the survey gathered general data about users’ experiences on the website, it did not provide any
          details behind why users felt the way they did. Because of this, we decided to perform a heuristic evaluation
          to find specific instances of usability issues, and usability testing to get further insight on our survey
          responses. </p>
      </section>


      <section class="sahiyo-he">
        <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
        <p>Because of our results from the survey, we wanted to determine the specific accessibility issues
          with sahiyo.org.
          Each team member examined the website according to <a
            href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"> Nielsen's usability heuristics</a>. We
          prioritized each issue by severity level. </p>
        <p>Most of the issues we found were related to the visual design of the site. We recommended that Sahiyo
          implement
          several changes to the website, such as <b>increasing the color contrast</b> of fonts and buttons, <b>adding
            alternative
            text</b> to images, <b>increasing keyboard accessibility</b>, and <b>adding text
            decoration</b> to links to make them more distinct. </p>
      </section>

      <section class="sahiyo-usability">
        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>In our usability tests, we wanted to assess users' ability to find information on sahiyo.org, specifically
          those who have visual impairments such as low vision or colorblindness.
        </p>
        <p>
          We used word of mouth, online forums, and survey responses to recruit users with visual disabilities and/or
          Sahiyo
          connections. We recruited five individuals of varying ages, disabilities, and levels of experience with
          sahiyo.org.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tests were conducted via Zoom and ranged from 20 – 60 minutes.

          Users generally had high success with general navigation within the site. Users experienced the most
          difficulty locating an event in the calendar which had the lowest average satisfaction rate at 1.6 and the
          lowest success rate at 50%. Additionally, some aspects of the site were out of date or broken, leaving users
          frustrated.
        </p>
        <p>For each task, the we recorded the participant's completion of the task, the time they took,
          and how
          satisfying they found the task. We also kept observations of participants in a color-coded spreadsheet, which
          allowed us to keep track of common issues and comments that users encountered. </p>

        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <p>Our recommendations seek to improve the accessibility of sahiyo.org in terms of online accessibility
          guidelines, as well as creating a site where information and community is easily available for those who are
          looking for it.
        </p>
        <p>We recommend...</p>
        <ol class="rec-list">
          <li>Improving site navigation by reorganizing the menu to align more with user expectations, and fixing
            broken links.</li>
          <li>Ensuring a more consistent site structure by removing outdated content and validate page titles to make
            sure
            they accurately reflect page content.
          </li>
          <li>Automatically redirecting old site to the new one.</li>
          <li>Increasing accessibility by fixing contrast issues with links, adding alt-text to all non-textual content,
            and ensuring proper responsiveness. </li>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>While our suggestions will help increase accessibility on sahiyo.org, we recommend that the Sahiyo team has
          regular audits of their content to make sure everything is up to date and still accessible to the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also recommend further accessibility testing to the mobile site, since we were unable to include that in
          our user testing. </p>
        <p>
          However, making even small changes to increase sahiyo.org’s accessibility will increase community engagement
          by
          making it easier for users to find information and interact with the site content.</p>

        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <p>While I'm someone who loves to try to plan for every eventuality, there’s still so much value to be gained
          from
          studies that don’t go perfectly, and being flexible is so important for being able to see that potential. </p>
        <p>My team learned this with our survey study.
          While we had few participants, their answers about their experiences (especially those who reported they had
          disabilities) pointed us towards focusing more on people with disabilities in our usability testing. We were
          able to identify some areas for improvement that hadn't been on our radar before. </p>
