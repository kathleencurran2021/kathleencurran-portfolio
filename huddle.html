        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Research shows that peer-to-peer connections are vital to thriving in an academic environment. These
          connections drive success not only socially, but also in terms of information about the school and career
          connections. There is quite a bit of research on undergraduate social support and subsequent orientation
          programs, but these
          seem to be optional or not prioritized for graduate student programs. </p>
        <p>In a program as large as the University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI), it is easy to get lost in
          the
          crowd, and it is especially
          difficult to enter this environment and connect with peers during Covid. This has resulted in a class that
          feels
          disconnected and lonely. </p>

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>Huddle is a project that hopes to bring together graduate students at UMSI. While there were some online
          platforms like Facebook that some were using to communicate, there was no centralized platform that people
          were
          comfortable just connecting with each other on. </p>
        <span><b>My project sought to answer the following:</b></span><br>
        <ol>
          <li>What kinds of connections at UMSI are students looking for? </li>
          <li>What has worked for students socially so far? </li>
          <li>Where are students struggling the most?</li>
          <li>How can a digital tool facilitate social connection at UMSI? </li>
        </ol>

      <section class="scope-constraints">
        <h3>Scope and Constraints</h3>
        <p>
          This was a short term project of about four months, so I was not able to spend as much time doing testing and
          redesigning as I would have liked. This application is also limited to my audience of UMSI graduate students.

          <h2>Process</h2>
          <h3>Interviews</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Before designing anything, I needed more information, so I conducted interviews with 5 UMSI students.
              <b>Each interviewee expressed that they had difficulty making friends.</b>
            <p>I had expected a result like this as it lined up with my initial research questions. However, most
              participants also expressed that <b> wanted a grad student-specific guide to UMSI</b>.
            </p>
            <p>Any other information they had found about Ann Arbor or UMSI had been disorganized or not specific to
              grad
              students, making it difficult to know if it was relevant to them.</p>

        <section class="huddle-personas">
          <h3>Personas</h3>
          <p>I created two primary personas based off the motivations and behaviors I observed from my interviews. These
            personas were vital for building empathy during the design process.</p>

          <h3>
            Story Mapping
          </h3>
          <p>With my personas and scenarios constructed, I created a story map for each. After creating three individual
            maps, I examined the variation in tasks between the users created
            a
            common path story map on the similarities, using sticky notes so I could move tasks as needed.</p>

          <p>With the story map, I was able to find patterns of use from my personas a that allowed me to begin
            development on a wireframe.</p>

        <section class="huddle-early-prototyping">
          <h3>Early Prototyping</h3>
          <p>I began with a sketched wireframe, focusing more on tasks and interactions over aesthetics.</p>
          <p>My early designs were really messy, as I focused on initial interactions and layout</p>
          <div class="wireframe-div">

          <div class="mid-fi-div">
            <img src="#">
          </div>
          <p>After getting feedback I created a mid-fidelity prototype. I'm starting to think about color and about the
            smaller details. I also added a navbar at the bottom for ease navigation</p>
        </section>

        <section class="huddle-testing">
          <h3>User Testing, Feedback, and Finding Bugs</h3>
          <p>After creating the mid-fidelity prototype I engaged in user testing and got five participants from my user
            pool to test the app by clicking through the mid-fidelity prototype. </p>
          <p>I gave each participant the same tasks and encouraged them to think aloud while they engaged with the
            prototype. At the end of each task, I recorded the ease of which they completed the task in a table.
          </p>
          <div class="huddle-usability-table">
            <img src="#">
          </div>

          <p>Not only did I get some valuable feedback about language consistency and interaction clarity, the usability
            testing found a major bug in the click-through prototype </p>


        </section>

        <section class="huddle-final-prototype">
          <p>These iterations of prototyping and feedback allowed me to create an interactive hi-fidelity prototype.

      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I learned a lot from this project. The first thing I learned was to <b>stay open-minded and be ready to
            pivot</b>. I was expecting to work on one problem, but my interviews ended up taking me a different
          direction, which surprised me, but it was a great lesson.</p>

        <p> The second thing I learned was to <b>trust the design process</b>. I was tempted to try and start designing
          a solution immediately. But in going through the whole design process, I was able to ensure that I was solving
          the right problem, and confidently defend my design decisions when I presented this project at the end.</p>

        <p> The last thing I learned was to <b>seek feedback early and often</b>. I really wanted my designs to be
          perfect early, and asking for feedback made me feel pretty vulnerable at first.
          But design is such an iterative process and getting another pair of eyes definitely helped me improve my
          design skills. </p>
