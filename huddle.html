        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Research shows that peer-to-peer connections are vital to thriving in
          an academic environment. These
          connections drive success not only socially, but also in terms of
          information about the school and career
          connections. There is quite a bit of research on undergraduate social
          support and subsequent orientation
          programs, but these
          seem to be optional or not prioritized for graduate student programs.
        </p>
        <p>In a program as large as the University of Michigan School of
          Information (UMSI), it is easy to get lost in
          the
          crowd, and it is especially
          difficult to enter this environment and connect with peers during
          Covid. This has resulted in a class that
          feels
          disconnected and lonely. </p>
      </section>

      <section class="challenge">
        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>Huddle is a project that hopes to bring together graduate students at
          UMSI. While there were some online
          platforms like Facebook that some were using to communicate, there was
          no centralized platform that people
          were
          comfortable just connecting with each other on. </p>
        <span><b>My project sought to answer the following:</b></span><br>
        <ol>
          <li>What kinds of connections at UMSI are students looking for? </li>
          <li>What has worked for students socially so far? </li>
          <li>Where are students struggling the most?</li>
          <li>How can a digital tool facilitate social connection at UMSI? </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section class="scope-constraints">
        <h3>Scope and Constraints</h3>
        <p>
          This was a short term project, so I was not able
          to spend as much time doing testing and
          redesigning as I would have liked. This application is also limited to
          my audience of UMSI graduate students.

          <h2>Process</h2>
          <h3>Interviews</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Before designing anything, I needed more information, so I
              conducted interviews with 5 UMSI students.
              <b>Each interviewee expressed that they had difficulty making
                friends.</b>
            <p>I had expected a result like this as it lined up with my initial
              research questions. However, most
              participants also expressed that before arriving in Ann Arbor,
              <b>information had been difficult to find
                because there were no unified resources</b>.
            </p>
            <p>Any information they had found about Ann Arbor or UMSI had been
              disorganized or not specific to
              grad students, making it difficult to know if it was relevant to
              them.</p>

        <section class="huddle-personas">
          <h3>Personas</h3>
          <p>I created two primary personas based off the motivations and
            behaviors I observed from my interviews. These
            personas were vital for building empathy during the design process.

            Story Mapping
          </h3>
          <p>With my personas and scenarios constructed, I created a story map
            for each. After creating three individual
            maps, I examined the variation in tasks between the users created
            a
            common path story map on the similarities, using sticky notes so I
            could move tasks as needed.</p>

          <p>With the story map, I was able to find patterns of use from my
            personas a that allowed me to begin
            development on a wireframe.</p>

        <section class="huddle-early-prototyping">
          <h3>Early Prototyping</h3>
          <p>I began with a sketched wireframe, focusing more on tasks and
            interactions over aesthetics. My early
            designs were messy, as I focused on interactions and layout.</p>

          </div>

          <p>After getting feedback I created a mid-fidelity prototype. In this
            iteration, I'm thinking more about the
            details.
            I also added a navbar at the bottom for easier navigation.</p>

        <section class="huddle-testing">
          <h3>User Testing, Feedback, and Finding Bugs</h3>
          <p>After creating the mid-fidelity prototype I engaged in user testing
            and got five participants from my user
            pool to test the app by clicking through the mid-fidelity prototype.
          </p>
          <p>I gave each participant the same tasks and encouraged them to think
            aloud while they engaged with the
            prototype. At the end of each task, I recorded the ease of which
            they completed the task in a table.

              exposed a navigation issue. </figcaption>
          </div>

          <p>The user testing showed that the
            prototype had inconsistent language that was confusing to users, as
            well as a bug in the navigation that made it impossible to complete
            one of the tasks. </p>

          <p>These iterations of prototyping and feedback allowed me to create

            This prototype includes a forum for University of Michigan students
            to ask questions of each other and share
            information and an archive-style resource section where people can

      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The final prototype addresses the user needs by helping students
          facilitate social connections both online and offline. The forum part
          of the prototype gives them a
          place to organize events, connect over common interests, or answer
          questions for each other. The resources library addresses the need for
          information by organizing information in one place and allowing people
          to contribute to it. </p>

        <div class="what-learned">
          <h3>What I Learned</h3>
          <p>I learned a lot from this project. The first thing I learned was to
            <b>stay open-minded and be ready to
              pivot</b>. I was expecting to work on one problem, but my
            interviews
            ended up taking me a different
            direction, which surprised me, but it was a great lesson.
          </p>

          <p> The second thing I learned was to <b>trust the design process</b>.
            When I began this project, it was
            tempting to try and start designing
            a solution immediately. But in going through the whole design
            process,
            I was able to ensure that I was solving
            the right problem, and confidently defend my design decisions when I
            presented this project at the end.</p>

          <p> The last thing I learned was to <b>seek feedback early and
              often</b>. I really wanted my designs to be
            perfect early, and asking for feedback made me feel pretty
            vulnerable
            at first.
            But design is such an iterative process and getting another pair of
            eyes definitely helped me improve my
            design skills. </p>
