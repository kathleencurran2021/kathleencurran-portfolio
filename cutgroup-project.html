      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>In a time when elections are fraught with anxiety, the Michigan Bureau of Elections (BOE)
        ensures that all Michigan elections are safe, organized, and legal. A state-run
        entity, the BOE helps local election officials on Election Day by providing them with the support and resources
        to make the election run smoothly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="challenge">
      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>Our challenge was to improve the BOE’s Election Inspector's Procedure Manual, a dense paper manual that the BOE
        supplies to each election location on Election Day as a resource to poll workers. While very thorough, the
        manual was dense and somewhat difficult to read, particularly within the chaos that can arise in a busy polling
        location.</p>
      <span><b>Our goals were as follows:</b></span><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Understand poll workers' current experiences with the manual. </li>
        <li>Test the manual with local poll workers to determine both degree and ease of use. </li>
        <li>Make specific recommendations that would allow poll workers to more easily solve any issues
          that arise on Election Day.</li>
      </ol>

    <div class="scope-constraints">
      <h3>Scope and Constraints</h3>
      <p>Civic User Testing Group (CUTGroup) projects are designed to be short and fast-paced in order to make public
        applications more accessible and useful to residents. One of the main constraints was that we only had about 3
        weeks on this project, which meant very little time to make up for any mistakes. This length also meant that we
        were limited on how deep our research could go or how perfect our sampling could be.</p>
      <p>
        Because of the short timeframe, we did have sampling bias issues - several of our participants were part of the
        University of Michigan Law School, and several others were contacts of the CUTGroup director.</p>

      <h2>The Process</h2>

      <div class="cutgroup-testing process-section">
        <h3>Testing the Manual</h3>
        <p>After meeting with our BOE stakeholder, we came up with a protocol and series of tasks for our users to test.
          These tests required them to flip through a copy of the paper Election Inspector’s Manual (provided by
          us).</p>

        <p>Our users were recruited by both our BOE representative and through contacts within the University of
          Michigan. We ended up with 10 users total, all of whom had worked the polls in the state of Michigan. Our
          users had varying levels of experience, ages, locations they had worked the polls, and political affiliations.
        </p>

        <p>The user testing took place over one evening. Each interview lasted around 30 minutes, was both over Zoom and
          in-person, and had an interview and a note-taker. Each member of our group took turns interviewing and taking
          notes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="cutgroup-findings process-section">
        <h3>What We Discovered</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The manual's current structure does not align with the user's expectactions</li>
          <li>Poll workers prefer easy-to-read instructions, but the manual is dense</li>
          <li>Visual hierarchy and graphics makes content easier to find</li>
          <li>The manual serves a different purpose depending on the user's role</li>
        </ol>
