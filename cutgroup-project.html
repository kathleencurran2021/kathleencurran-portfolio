                <br />
                The Michigan Bureau of Elections provides a dense paper manual at all polling locations to help poll
                workers with any issues that arise at the polls. As they look towards future digitization, they aren’t
                sure how poll workers use the manual, if at all.

                <b>Solution</b>
                <br />
                We reorganized the manual based on what different poll workers would need, and created a visual
                hierarchy guide to increase searchability in the dense manual.

          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            In a time when elections are fraught with anxiety, the Michigan Bureau of Elections (BOE) ensures that all
            Michigan elections are safe, organized, and legal. A state-run entity, the BOE helps local election
            officials on Election Day by providing them with the support and resources to make the election run
            smoothly.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge">
          <h4>The Challenge</h4>
          <p>
            Our challenge was to improve the BOE’s Election Inspector's Procedure Manual, a dense paper manual that the
            BOE supplies to each election location on Election Day as a resource to poll workers. While thorough, the
            40-page manual was dense and lacked searchability, particularly within the chaos that can arise in a busy
            polling location.
          </p>
          <span><b>Our goals were as follows:</b></span>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>Understand poll workers' current experiences with the manual.</li>
            <li>Test the manual with local poll workers to determine both degree and ease of use.</li>
            <li>
              Make specific recommendations that would allow poll workers to more easily solve any issues that arise on
              Election Day.

          <h4>Scope and Constraints</h4>
          <p>
            Civic User Testing Group (CUTGroup) projects are designed to be short and fast-paced in order to make public
            applications more accessible and useful to residents. One of the main constraints was the three-week time
            frame, which meant that we were limited on how deep our research could go or how particular we could be
            about recruiting participants.

            <h3>Rapid Testing, Rapid Results</h3>
            <p>
              In this project, gaining quick and actionable insights was vital. Conducting rapid user testing allowed us
              to quickly understand user experience and identify pain points with the manual. We were well aware of the
              flaws and understand that rapid testing doesn't offer the same breadth or depth of insights, the quick
              turnaround time made it the perfect method for this project.

            <h4>Testing the Manual</h4>
            <p>
              After meeting with our BOE stakeholder, we came up with a protocol and series of tasks for our users to
              test. These tests required them to flip through a copy of the paper Election Inspector’s Manual (provided
              by us).
            </p>
            <p>
              Our users were recruited by both our BOE representative and through contacts within the University of
              Michigan. We ended up with 10 users total, all of whom had worked the polls in the state of Michigan. Our
              users had varying levels of experience, ages, locations they had worked the polls, and political
              affiliations.
            </p>
            <p>The user testing took place over one evening, with each interview lasting around 30 minutes.</p>

                  location and had difficulty finding the right information.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                  Typical poll workers tend to use the manual
                  <b>only for procedural tasks,</b>
                  and then ask the precinct chair whenever issues arise. Because of this, we suggest splitting the

                <p>
                  <b>Part 1 would include step by step procedures</b>
                  for all poll workers to follow, such as setting up the precinct or closing the polls.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Part 2 would include more detailed information about edge cases or issues that might arise</b>
                  on Election day. This part is intended for the precinct chair, who generally has more authority and
                  experience to solve problems at the polls.

                </p>
                <p>
                  We propose a series of ‘Voters, Know Your Rights’ posters that can be displayed around the precinct to

            In the end, the Michigan Bureau of Elections
            <b>
              included over 60% of the team's recommendations into the new version of the Election Inspector's Procedure
              Manual,
            </b>
            including updating the Table of Contents, adding bullet points and numbering for procedural tasks, and
            putting relevant tasks into chronological order.
          </p>

          <p>
            While our methods and findings certainly were not perfect, we did make a positive impact on the Michigan BOE
            by giving them the data they needed to make informed, user-centric decisions about how to update the manual
            for the upcoming 2022 midterm elections.

            <h4>What I Learned</h4>
            <p>
              While a lot of UX research tends to focus on digital tools like websites, it still has great uses for
              things that are not on the web.
              <b>CUTgroup was an excellent practice in applying UX research methods to solve offline problems</b>
              .
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the big themes of CUTGroup is, 'Don't let perfect be the enemy of the good.' In a project like this
              with such a short timeline, we simply didn't have time to make things perfect. It was tempting to think in
              terms of
              <i>‘if we only had more time we could…’</i>
              but instead we
              <b>focused on the areas we could add the most value.</b>
