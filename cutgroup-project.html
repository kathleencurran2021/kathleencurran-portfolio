        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In a time when elections are fraught with anxiety, the Michigan
          Bureau of Elections (BOE)
          ensures that all Michigan elections are safe, organized, and legal. A
          state-run
          entity, the BOE helps local election officials on Election Day by
          providing them with the support and
          resources to make the election run smoothly.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="challenge">
        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>Our challenge was to improve the BOE’s Election Inspector's Procedure
          Manual, a dense paper manual that the
          BOE supplies to each election location on Election Day as a resource
          to poll workers. While very thorough, the
          manual was dense and somewhat difficult to read, particularly within
          the chaos that can arise in a busy
          polling location.</p>
        <span><b>Our goals were as follows:</b></span><br>
        <ol>
          <li>Understand poll workers' current experiences with the manual.
          </li>
          <li>Test the manual with local poll workers to determine both degree
            and ease of use. </li>
          <li>Make specific recommendations that would allow poll workers to
            more easily solve any issues
            that arise on Election Day.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="scope-constraints">
        <h3>Scope and Constraints</h3>
        <p>Civic User Testing Group (CUTGroup) projects are designed to be short
          and fast-paced in order to make public
          applications more accessible and useful to residents. One of the main
          constraints was the short time frame, which meant that we were limited
          on how deep our research could go or how particular we could be about
          participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, we did have sampling bias issues -
          several of our participants were part of
          the
          University of Michigan Law School, and several others were contacts of
          the CUTGroup director.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-process">
        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <div class="cutgroup-testing process-section">
          <h3>Testing the Manual</h3>
          <p>After meeting with our BOE stakeholder, we came up with a protocol
            and series of tasks for our users to
            test.
            These tests required them to flip through a copy of the paper
            Election Inspector’s Manual (provided by
            us).</p>
          <p>Our users were recruited by both our BOE representative and through
            contacts within the University of
            Michigan. We ended up with 10 users total, all of whom had worked
            the polls in the state of Michigan. Our
            users had varying levels of experience, ages, locations they had
            worked the polls, and political
            affiliations.
          </p>
          <p>The user testing took place over one evening. Each interview lasted
            around 30 minutes, was both over Zoom
            and
            in-person, and had an interview and a note-taker. Each member of our
            group took turns interviewing and
            taking
            notes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="cutgroup-findings process-section">
          <h4>Key Findings</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>The manual's current structure does not align with the user's
              expectactions</li>
            <li>Poll workers prefer easy-to-read instructions, but the manual is
              dense</li>
            <li>Visual hierarchy and graphics makes content easier to find</li>
            <li>The manual may serve different purposes depending on the user's
              role at the polling location</li>

              <h5>1. Restructure the manual to reflect user
                expectations.</h5>
              <p>Many users expected the manual to be in chronological order,
                or
                similar topics to be in the same
                location
                and thus had difficulty finding the right information.</p>
              <p>Reordering the manual to be in chronological order would
                better
                align the
                manual with user
                assumptions.</p>

              <p>Adding visual hierarchy to the manual like in the example

                  tasks</b>, and then ask the precinct chair
                whenever issues arise. Because of this, we suggest splitting the
                manual into two parts. </p>
              <p><b>Part 1 would include step by step procedures</b> for all
                poll
                workers to follow,
                such as setting up the precinct or closing the polls. </p>
              <p> <b>Part 2 would include more detailed information about edge
                  cases or issues that might arise</b> on Election
                day. This part is intended for the precinct chair, who
                generally
                has more authority and experience to
                solve problems at the polls.</p>

                voters.</h5>
              </span>
              <p>Because the manual has so much information, it is difficult
                to
                find the right information quickly. </p>
              <p>We propose a series of ‘Voters, Know Your Rights’
                posters
                that can be displayed around the
                precinct to help guide voters at the polls <b>to give voters
                  easy
                  access to important information</b>, instead of having to
                rely on
                poll workers.
              </p>
              <p>We also propose creating infographic outlines to common
                procedures and issues
                that poll workers can keep on the table
                with them to quickly reference in the case of a question <b>to

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In the end, the Michigan Bureau of Elections <b> included over 60% of
            the team's recommendations
            into the new version of the Election Inspector's
            Procedure Manual, </b> including updating
          the
          Table of Contents, adding bullet points and numbering for procedural
          tasks, and putting relevant tasks into
          chronological order. </p>

        <p>While our methods and findings certainly were not perfect, we did
          make a positive impact on the Michigan BOE
          by
          giving them the data they needed to make informed, user-centric
          decisions about how to update the manual for
          the upcoming 2022 midterm elections.</p>

        <div class="what-learned">
          <h3>What I Learned</h3>
          <p>While a lot of UX research tends to focus on digital tools like
            websites, it
            still has great uses for things that are not on the web.
            <b>CUTgroup
              was an excellent practice in
              applying UX research methods to solve offline problems</b>.
          </p>

          <p>One of the big themes of CUTGroup is, 'Don't let perfect be the
            enemy of the good.' In a project like this
            with such a short timeline, we simply didn't have time to make
            things perfect. It was tempting to think in
            terms of <i>‘if we only had more time we could…’</i> but instead
            we
            <b> focused on the areas we could add
              the most value</b>.
