        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Sahiyo (pronounced Say-yo) is an international organization dedicated
          to fighting for women's rights,
          specifically in the area of female genital cutting (FGC). They work to
          empower communities to end FGC and
          create social change through education and community involvement on
          their website, sahiyo.org.

        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="challenge">
        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>Sahiyo uses their website to post resources for FGC as well as foster
          community involvement.
          However, the website is not always accessible and users often have
          difficulty
          finding the resources they need, particularly with event information.
          Throughout the study, our team sought to answer the following
          question:</p>
        <span class="challenge-statement">“What accessibility challenges do
          users encounter
          when they use Sahiyo’s website, and how are those issues negatively
          impacting user engagement across the site?”</span>
      </section>

      <section class="scope-constraints">
        <h3>Scope and Constraints</h3>
        <p>
          The project was limited to four months. Due to this time constraint,
          we decided to work primarily with the desktop version of sahiyo.org
          because analytics showed that most visitors accessed the site
          on desktop, despite there being a mobile version as well.</p>

          <h3>Interview Study</h3>
          <p>We conducted an interview study which sought to understand the
            primary goals, pain points, and needs of
            users
            navigating the Sahiyo website. </p>
          <p> We conducted six interviews each
            lasting between 30-60 minutes. Interviewees were recruited with the
            help of Sahiyo leadership and through
            online forums
            for people with disabilities.</p>

          <h3>
            Survey
          </h3>
          <p>To better understand how users of varying abilities engaged with
            sahiyo.org, we launched a survey to the
            Sahiyo community. Our goal was to <b>understand people's experiences
              with the site,
              especially for anyone who had a disability</b>. </p>
          <p>
            The survey had several limitations. First, we did not receive
            enough
            responses for our survey results to be statistically significant.
            Secondly, the majority of respondents were
            either Sahiyo staff or volunteers which may not be representative of
            typical users. </p>
          <p>
            However, our results indicated that <b>users with disabilities had a
              more negative experience using the site than
              those without disabilities.</b> </p>
          <div class="survey-img-container">
            <figure class="surv-res-fig">
              <img class="survey-results-img"
                src="images/sahiyo imgs/survey-results1.png"
                alt="Crosstab image showing results from a survey question asking about user's experience with Sahiyo">
              <figcaption>A crosstab comparing the average experiences of users
                who reported disabilities to
                those who did
                not. </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>
            The survey showed that people with reported disabilities had lower
            satisfaction with the site in every area. In particular, their
            experiences in finding information on Sahiyo events was
            significantly more negative.
          </p>

          <p>These responses suggested that there <b>were
              issues within the site affecting accessibility and engagement</b>,
            especially
            when it came to Sahiyo events.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because of this, we decided to perform a heuristic
            evaluation to identify specific usability issues. </p>

        <section class="sahiyo-he">
          <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
          <p>Because of our results from the survey, we wanted to determine the
            specific accessibility issues
            with sahiyo.org.
            Each team member examined the website according to
            <span class="some-link">
              <a

            </span>.
            We prioritized each issue by severity level.
          </p>
          <p>Most of the issues we found were related to the visual design of
            the site. We recommended that Sahiyo
            implement
            several changes to the website, such as <b>increasing the color
              contrast</b> of fonts and buttons, <b>adding
              alternative text</b> to images, <b>increasing keyboard
              accessibility</b>, and <b>adding text
              decoration</b> to links to make them more distinct. </p>
        </section>

        <section class="sahiyo-usability">
          <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>In our usability tests, we wanted to assess users' ability to find
            information on sahiyo.org, specifically
            those who have visual impairments such as low vision or
            colorblindness.
          </p>
          <p>
            We used word of mouth, online forums, and survey responses to
            recruit users with visual disabilities and/or
            Sahiyo
            connections. We recruited five individuals of varying ages,
            disabilities, and levels of experience with
            sahiyo.org.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tests were conducted via Zoom and ranged from 20 – 60 minutes.

            Users generally had high success with general navigation within the
            site and had the most
            frustration locating an event in the calendar. Additionally, some
            aspects of the site were out of date or
            broken, leaving users
            frustrated.

          <p>For each task, the we recorded the participant's completion of the
            task, the time they took,
            and how
            satisfying they found the task. We also kept observations of
            participants in a color-coded spreadsheet,

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Next Steps</h3>
          <p>While our suggestions will help increase accessibility on
            sahiyo.org, we recommend that the Sahiyo team has
            regular audits of their content to make sure everything is up to
            date and still accessible to the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also recommend further accessibility testing to the mobile site,
            since we were unable to include that in
            our user testing. </p>
          <p>
            However, making even small changes to increase sahiyo.org’s
            accessibility will increase community engagement
            by making it easier for users to find information and interact with
            the site content.</p>

          <h3>What I Learned</h3>
          <p>While I love to try to plan for every eventuality, there’s still so
            much value to be gained
            from studies that don’t go perfectly, and being flexible is so
            important for being able to see that
            potential.
          </p>
          <p>My team learned this with our survey study.
            While we had few participants, their answers about their experiences
            (especially those who reported they had
            disabilities) pointed us towards focusing more on people with
            disabilities in our usability testing. We were
            able to identify some areas for improvement that hadn't been on our
            radar before. </p>
