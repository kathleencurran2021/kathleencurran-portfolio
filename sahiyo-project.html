        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Sahiyo (pronounced Say-yo) is an international organization dedicated to fighting for women's rights,
          specifically in the area of female genital cutting (FGC). They work to empower communities to end FGC and
          create social change through education and community involvement on their website, sahiyo.org.</p>
      </div>
      <br>

      <br><br>

    </div>
    <div id="sahiyo-challenge" class="challenge">
      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>Sahiyo uses their website to guide community involvement. The organization posts resources for victims or
        people who want to help, testimonies from people involved in FGC, and information about community events.
        However, the website is not always accessible to those with disabilities, and users often have difficulty
        finding the resources they need, particularly with event information.
        We then created the following statement to guide our research:</p>
      <span class="challenge-statement"><b>“What challenges do users encounter when they use Sahiyo’s website, and
          how will solving those issues
          increase site-wide accessibility and user engagement?”</b></span>
    </div>

    <div id="sahiyo-scope" class="scope-constraints">
      <h3>Scope and Constraints</h3>
      <p>
        The project was limited to four months, which made it difficult to spend as much time as we would have liked
        in data collection. Due to this time constraint, we were only able to work with the desktop version of
        sahiyo.org, even though there is a mobile version of the site.
        Additionally, it was difficult to recruit participants for interviews, a survey, and user testing, in part
        because we were unable to provide a monetary incentive. We recruited mostly from Sahiyo’s contacts and word of
        mouth from our team.</p>

    </div>



    <div id="sahiyo-process" class="project-process">
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <div class="interview-study">
        <h3>Interview Study</h3>
        <p>We conducted an interview study which sought to understand the primary goals, pain points, and needs of users
          navigating the Sahiyo website. <br> <br> We conducted six interviews with users and stakeholders on Zoom, each
          one
          lasting between 30-60 minutes. Interviewees were recruited through Sahiyo leadership and through online forums
          for people with disabilities.</p>
        <span>We found that:</span>
        <ol>
          <li>Users believed that sahiyo.org was mostly effective at meeting their needs</li>
          <li>Users struggled with accessibility issues like responsiveness, especially with the mobile version</li>
          <li>Many users believed that storytelling (such as the blog) is a vital part of connecting the Sahiyo
            community</li>
          <li>Users often accidentally navigated to Sahiyo’s old website (sahiyo.com), since it is more prevalent in
            Google search results</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="sahiyo-personas">
        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>We used information from our interviews to create personas for sahiyo.org users.
          These personas allowed us to better understand our target audience and keep in mind user's needs as we made
          decisions.</p>

      <br>
      <div class="sahiyo-survey">
        <h3>
          Survey
        </h3>
        <p>To better understand how users of varying abilities engaged with sahiyo.org, we launched a survey to the
          Sahiyo community, asking about their experience with the website, their role in Sahiyo, their disability
          status, and how often they used the site. <br><br>
          The survey had several limitations that weakened our data’s accuracy. First, we did not receive enough
          responses for our survey results to be statistically significant. Secondly, the majority of respondents were
          either Sahiyo staff or volunteers which may not be representative of typical users. <br><br>
          However, our results indicated that users with disabilities had a more difficult time using the site than
          those without disabilities. </p>
        <img src="images/survey-results.png">
        <p>While the survey gathered general data about users’ experiences on the website, it did not provide any
          details behind why users felt the way they did. Because of this, we decided to perform a heuristic evaluation
          to find specific instances of usability issues, and usability testing to get further insight on our survey
          responses. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sahiyo-he">
        <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
        <p>Because of our results from the survey, we wanted to determine the specific accessibility issues
          with sahiyo.org.
          Each team member examined the website according to <a
            href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"> Nielsen's usability heuristics</a>. We
          prioritized each issue by severity level. </p>
        <p>Most of the issues we found were related to the visual design of the site. We recommended that Sahiyo
          implement
          several changes to the website, such as <b>increasing the color contrast</b> of fonts and buttons, <b>adding
            alternative
            text</b> to images, <b>increasing keyboard accessibility</b>, and <b>adding text
            decoration</b> to links to make them more distinct. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sahiyo-usability">
        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>In our usability tests, we wanted to assess users' ability to find information on sahiyo.org, specifically
          those who have visual impairments such as low vision or colorblindness. <br><br>
          We used word of mouth, online forums, and survey responses to recruit users with visual disabilities and/or
          Sahiyo
          connections. We recruited five individuals of varying ages, disabilities, and levels of experience with
          sahiyo.org.<br><br>

          Tests were conducted via Zoom and ranged from 20 – 60 minutes.

          <span id="sahiyo-script-link">

          </span>
          Users generally had high success with general navigation within the site. Users experienced the most
          difficulty locating an event in the calendar which had the lowest average satisfaction rate at 1.6 and the
          lowest success rate at 50%. Additionally, some aspects of the site were out of date or broken, leaving users
          frustrated.
        </p>
        <p>For each task, the we recorded the participant's completion of the task, the time they took,
          and how
          satisfying they found the task. We also kept observations of participants in a color-coded spreadsheet, which
          allowed us to keep track of common issues and comments that users encountered. </p>
