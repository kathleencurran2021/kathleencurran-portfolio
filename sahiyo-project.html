                We created a guide of recommendations for prioritizing accessibility, as well as tools they can use to
                further monitor their accessibility. This solution should increase accessibility among visually impaired

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Sahiyo (pronounced Say-yo) is an international organization dedicated to fighting for women's rights,
            specifically in the area of female genital cutting (FGC). They work to empower communities to end FGC and
            create social change through education and community involvement on their website, sahiyo.org.

          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Sahiyo uses their website to share resources for FGC and create community. However, the website is not
            completelt accessible and users often have difficulty finding the resources they need. Throughout the study,
            our team sought to answer the following question:
          </p>
          <span class="challenge-statement">
            “What accessibility challenges do users encounter when they use Sahiyo’s website, and how do those issues
            impact user engagement across the site?”

            The project was limited to four months. Analytics showed that visitors primarily accessed the site on the

            <p>
              We conducted six interviews each lasting between 30-60 minutes. Interviewees were recruited with the help

            <h3>Survey</h3>
            <p>
              To better understand how users of varying abilities engaged with sahiyo.org, we launched a survey to the
              Sahiyo community. Our goal was to
              <b>understand people's experiences with the site, especially for anyone with a disability.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              The survey had several limitations. First, we did not receive enough responses for our survey results to
              be statistically significant. Secondly, the majority of respondents were either Sahiyo staff or volunteers
              which may not be representative of typical users.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, our results indicated that
              <b>
                users with disabilities had a more negative experience using the site than those without disabilities.
              </b>
            </p>
            <div class="survey-img-container">
              <figure class="surv-res-fig">

            </div>

            <p>
              The survey showed that
              <b>people who reported disabilities had lower satisfaction with the site in every area.</b>
              In particular, their experiences in finding information on Sahiyo events was significantly more negative.
            </p>

            <p>
              These responses suggested that there
              <b>were issues within the site affecting accessibility and engagement</b>
              , especially when it came to Sahiyo events.
            </p>

            <p>Because of this, we decided to perform a heuristic evaluation to identify specific usability issues.</p>

            <h3>Identifying Accessibility Issues</h3>
            <p>
              Because of our results from the survey, we wanted to determine the specific accessibility issues with
              sahiyo.org. Each team member examined the website according to
              <span class="some-link">

              We prioritized each issue by severity level.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of the issues we found were related to the visual design of the site. We recommended that Sahiyo
              implement several changes, such as:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>increasing the color contrast of fonts and buttons</li>
              <li>adding alternative text to images</li>
              <li>increasing keyboard accessibility</li>

              Users generally had high success with general navigation within the site. They were generally able to
              locate Sahiyo's blog, which is consistent with the satisfaction results from our survey.

            <p>
              However, users had difficulty locating Sahiyo events in the calendar. Additionally, some resources on the
              site were out of date or broken, leaving users frustrated.

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>
              During our research, we discovered that while many of the accessibility issues on sahiyo.org were things
              that were easily fixable (color contrast, alt-text, responsiveness, etc) they caused much frustration for
              our users and negatively impacted how they used the site.
            </p>
            <p>
              While we recommended specific ways to fix the accessibility issues we found, it will be important for
              Sahiyo to conduct regular audits of their site to make sure everything is up to date and still accessible
              to the community. We also recommend further accessibility testing to the mobile site, since we were unable
              to include that in our user testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Making even small changes to increase sahiyo.org’s accessibility will increase community engagement by
              making it easier for users to find information and interact with the site content, helping them continue
              their mission of creating positive social change and ending FGC.

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>
              If there had been more time,
              <b>I would have loved to conduct a card sort exercise.</b>
              We were able to come up with solutions for many of the accessibility issues, but
              <b>
                our usability test showed there was confusion with sahiyo.org's organization, and our users had
                difficulty finding information.
              </b>
              A card sort could help determine a better way to structure the site.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also learned there’s still
              <b>so much value to gain from studies that don’t go perfectly</b>
              . Our survey didn't get the number of responses responses we had hoped, but the responses we did receive
              helped the team find the right direction for usability testing. Being flexible and willing to pivot helped
              the team see value in the data we got, and ultimately find success.
